# Vitamin E

## What is it?
Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as a potent antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. It is important for immune function and the health of the skin and eyes.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Deficiency is very rare in healthy people and is usually linked to genetic disorders or diseases that cause severe fat malabsorption.
**Improvements:** Increase intake of Vitamin E-rich foods, such as nuts (almonds), seeds (sunflower), avocados, and vegetable oils.

## High Results
**Causes:** High levels are due to supplementation with high doses. Although considered one of the less toxic fat-soluble vitamins, very high doses can interfere with blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding.
**Improvements:** Reduce or discontinue Vitamin E supplementation.
