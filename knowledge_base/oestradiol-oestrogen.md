# Oestradiol (Oestrogen)

## What is it?
Oestradiol is the most potent form of oestrogen, the main female sex hormone. It is crucial for female sexual development, regulation of the menstrual cycle, and bone health. Men also produce small amounts, which are important for erectile function and sperm production.

## Low Results
**Causes:** In premenopausal women, it may indicate an ovarian or pituitary problem. It is normal for levels to drop dramatically during menopause, which causes symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Low body weight and excessive exercise can also suppress it.
**Improvements:** Treatment depends on the cause. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is an option for managing menopausal symptoms.

## High Results
**Causes:** In women, it may be associated with PCOS or ovarian tumors. In men, high levels (often due to the conversion of testosterone to oestrogen in fat tissue) can cause gynecomastia (development of breast tissue) and erectile dysfunction. Obesity is a major risk factor.
**Improvements:** In men, weight management is key to reducing the conversion of testosterone. In both sexes, medical evaluation is required to determine the cause.
