# Creatine Kinase

## What is it?
Creatine Kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in the heart, brain, and, mainly, skeletal muscles. It is released into the blood when there is muscle damage.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Low CK levels are not usually a cause for concern and may be seen in people with low muscle mass or who are very sedentary.
**Improvements:** Generally, no action is required. Regular strength training can help increase muscle mass and normalize levels.

## High Results
**Causes:** Intense physical exercise is the most common cause of temporary elevation. Other causes include muscle injuries (trauma), certain muscular dystrophies, muscle inflammation (myositis), or the side effect of some medications (like statins).
**Improvements:** If the elevation is due to exercise, it is a normal response and resolves with rest. If there is no obvious cause, a medical evaluation is needed to rule out other conditions.
