# Globulin

## What is it?
Globulin is a group of proteins in the blood. They are produced by the immune system and the liver. They are divided into alpha, beta, and gamma globulins (antibodies are gamma globulins). They are crucial for liver function, blood clotting, and fighting infections.

## Low Results
**Causes:** May indicate liver or kidney problems, or genetic disorders affecting protein production. It can also be associated with malnutrition or malabsorption conditions.
**Improvements:** Treatment depends on the underlying cause. A balanced, protein-rich diet is fundamental.

## High Results
**Causes:** It is often a sign of inflammation, chronic infection, or certain autoimmune disorders (like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis), as the body produces more antibodies. Certain types of blood cancer (like multiple myeloma) can also elevate it.
**Improvements:** Requires a thorough medical investigation to identify and treat the cause of the inflammation or underlying condition.
