# Active B12 (Holotranscobalamin)

## What is it?
Active Vitamin B12, or holotranscobalamin, is the form of B12 that the body can use directly. It is a more sensitive indicator of B12 status than the total measurement, as it reflects the amount that is actually available to the cells.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Insufficient dietary intake is the most common cause, especially in vegan or vegetarian diets. It can also be due to absorption problems in the gut, such as atrophic gastritis or long-term use of certain heartburn medications.
**Improvements:** Increase intake of B12-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. For plant-based diets, it is essential to consume fortified foods or take a B12 supplement.

## High Results
**Causes:** High levels are uncommon and are usually due to excessive supplementation. Rarely, they can be associated with certain liver or blood conditions, so medical evaluation is important if supplements are not being taken.
**Improvements:** If due to supplementation, adjust the dosage according to a healthcare professional's instructions.
