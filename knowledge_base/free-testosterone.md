# Free Testosterone

## What is it?
Free testosterone is the fraction of testosterone in the blood that is not bound to proteins (mainly SHBG and albumin) and is therefore biologically active and available for use by the body's tissues. It is a more accurate indicator of androgenic status than total testosterone.

## Low Results
**Causes:** In men, it can cause symptoms such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, loss of muscle mass, and depressed mood. Causes can be aging, obesity, chronic stress, or underlying medical conditions.
**Improvements:** Strength training, maintaining a healthy body weight, ensuring quality sleep, managing stress, and a diet rich in nutrients (zinc, vitamin D) can help optimize levels.

## High Results
**Causes:** In women, elevated levels are a sign of hyperandrogenism and can be associated with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), causing acne, excessive hair growth, and menstrual irregularities. In men, it may be due to the use of anabolic steroids.
**Improvements:** Treatment focuses on the cause. For women with PCOS, lifestyle interventions like diet and exercise are fundamental.
