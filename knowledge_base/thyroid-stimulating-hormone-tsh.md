# Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)

## What is it?
Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is produced by the pituitary gland. Its job is to tell the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones (T4 and T3). It is the most important initial test to assess thyroid function.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low TSH level (with high T4/T3) indicates hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). The pituitary gland detects that there is too much thyroid hormone and stops sending the signal. The most common cause is Graves' Disease.
**Improvements:** Requires medical treatment, which may include anti-thyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or surgery.

## High Results
**Causes:** A high TSH level (with low T4/T3) indicates hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). The pituitary detects that there is not enough thyroid hormone and "shouts" (increases TSH) to try to get the thyroid to work harder. The most common cause is Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.
**Improvements:** The standard treatment is hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine (synthetic T4).
