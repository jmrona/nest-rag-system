# Smoking's Impact on Health

## General Effects
Smoking is a major cause of chronic inflammation, which can elevate markers like **hs-CRP** and **Ferritin**. It introduces oxidative stress, depleting antioxidants like **Vitamin E** and **C**. It also increases carbon monoxide in the blood, prompting the body to produce more **red blood cells (RBC)** and **haemoglobin** to compensate, which can lead to higher readings.

## Specific Biomarker Impacts
- **hs-CRP:** Smoking is a direct cause of vascular inflammation, leading to elevated hs-CRP.
- **Haemoglobin/RBC:** Often elevated as the body tries to increase oxygen-carrying capacity.
- **Lipids:** Smoking tends to lower "good" HDL cholesterol and promote the oxidation of "bad" LDL cholesterol, making it more harmful.
- **Vitamins:** Can deplete levels of several vitamins, particularly antioxidants.
