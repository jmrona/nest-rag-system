# Sedentary Lifestyle's Impact

## General Effects
A sedentary lifestyle contributes to poor metabolic health, including weight gain and insulin resistance. This affects a wide range of biomarkers related to cardiovascular health and blood sugar control.

## Specific Biomarker Impacts
- **HDL Cholesterol:** Lack of physical activity is a primary cause of low "good" HDL cholesterol.
- **Triglycerides:** Often elevated due to reduced energy expenditure and potential weight gain.
- **HbA1c:** Can increase over time due to developing insulin resistance.
- **Creatine Kinase (CK):** May be very low, reflecting low muscle mass.
- **Vitamin D:** While not directly caused by being sedentary, it's often correlated due to less time spent outdoors.
