# Chronic Stress's Impact

## General Effects
Chronic stress puts the body in a constant "fight or flight" mode, leading to hormonal imbalances and inflammation that can affect multiple systems.

## Specific Biomarker Impacts
- **Cortisol:** Chronic stress leads to dysregulation of the HPA axis. This can manifest as high cortisol levels, or eventually, "burnout" with inappropriately low morning cortisol.
- **hs-CRP:** Stress is a significant driver of chronic, low-grade inflammation, leading to elevated hs-CRP.
- **TSH/Thyroid Hormones:** High cortisol can suppress the conversion of inactive T4 to active T3 thyroid hormone, potentially affecting energy levels even if TSH looks normal.
- **SHBG:** High stress and cortisol can sometimes suppress SHBG, affecting the balance of free sex hormones.
