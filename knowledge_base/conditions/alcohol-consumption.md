# Alcohol Consumption's Impact

## Liver Health
Alcohol is processed by the liver, and excessive consumption is a primary cause of elevated liver enzymes like **GGT** and **ALT**. Chronic heavy drinking can lead to fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis.

## Nutrient Deficiencies
Alcohol can interfere with the absorption and storage of several key nutrients, particularly **B-vitamins** like **Folate** and **Active B12**, and minerals like **Magnesium**.

## Specific Biomarker Impacts
- **GGT & ALT:** Very sensitive to alcohol intake and will often be elevated.
- **Folate & B12:** Alcohol can impair their absorption, leading to lower levels.
- **Triglycerides:** Alcohol is high in calories and sugar, and its consumption can significantly raise triglyceride levels.
