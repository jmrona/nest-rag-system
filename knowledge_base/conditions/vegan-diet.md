# Vegan Diet's Impact

## General Effects
A well-planned vegan diet can be incredibly healthy, but it requires careful attention to certain nutrients that are less abundant or less bioavailable in plant-based foods.

## Potential Nutrient Deficiencies
- **Active B12:** This vitamin is almost exclusively found in animal products. Supplementation is essential for anyone on a long-term vegan diet.
- **Ferritin (Iron):** Plant-based iron (non-heme) is less easily absorbed than iron from animal sources (heme). Low ferritin is common if intake is not optimized.
- **Vitamin D:** Dietary sources are limited, similar to other diets, so supplementation is often needed.
- **Omega-3:** Plant sources provide ALA, but conversion to active EPA/DHA is inefficient. Algae oil supplements can be beneficial.

## Potential Benefits
- **Lipids:** Vegan diets are often associated with lower LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol.
- **HbA1c:** Typically associated with better insulin sensitivity and lower HbA1c levels.
