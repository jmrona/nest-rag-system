# Haemoglobin

## What is it?
Haemoglobin is an iron-rich protein found in red blood cells. Its main function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low haemoglobin level is the definition of anemia. The most common cause is iron deficiency. Other causes include deficiencies of vitamin B12 or folate, chronic diseases, or blood loss.
**Improvements:** If the cause is iron deficiency, increase iron-rich foods and vitamin C. If due to other vitamin deficiencies, supplement as needed. It is crucial to identify the cause of the anemia.

## High Results
**Causes:** Can be a response of the body to a need for greater oxygen-carrying capacity, such as living at high altitudes or smoking (due to carbon monoxide exposure). It can also be a sign of a bone marrow disease called polycythemia vera. Dehydration can also concentrate the blood and falsely elevate levels.
**Improvements:** Quitting smoking is the most important measure if applicable. Maintain good hydration. If a medical cause is suspected, hematological evaluation is required.
