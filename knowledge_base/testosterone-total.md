# Testosterone (Total)

## What is it?
Total testosterone measures the total amount of testosterone in the blood, including that which is bound to proteins (SHBG, albumin) and that which is free. It is the main male sex hormone but is also important for women's health.

## Low Results
**Causes:** In men, levels naturally decrease with age. Other causes include obesity, chronic stress, lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and medical conditions. It causes fatigue, low libido, and loss of muscle mass. In women, it can also cause fatigue and low libido.
**Improvements:** Lifestyle: strength training, weight management, 8 hours of sleep, stress management, and a diet rich in zinc and vitamin D.

## High Results
**Causes:** In women, it is a sign of hyperandrogenism, often linked to PCOS. In men, levels well above the normal range may suggest the use of anabolic steroids or, rarely, a tumor.
**Improvements:** Treatment focuses on the cause. For women with PCOS, diet and exercise are fundamental.
