# Magnesium (serum)

## What is it?
Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in more than 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, including energy production, muscle and nerve function, and blood glucose control. Serum magnesium measures the amount in the blood, although most of the body's magnesium is found in bones and cells.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Insufficient dietary intake, excessive alcohol consumption, certain medications (like diuretics), and gastrointestinal disorders that affect absorption can cause deficiency.
**Improvements:** Increase consumption of magnesium-rich foods like green leafy vegetables, nuts (almonds), seeds, legumes, and dark chocolate. A supplement may be necessary.

## High Results
**Causes:** It is rare and usually occurs in people with kidney disease, as the kidneys cannot eliminate excess magnesium. It can also be caused by excessive supplementation.
**Improvements:** If due to supplements, reduce the dose. If there is kidney disease, medical management is required to control electrolyte levels.
