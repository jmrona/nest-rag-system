# LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)

## What is it?
LDL is known as the "bad" cholesterol. Its function is to transport cholesterol from the liver to the cells, but when there is an excess, it can be deposited on the artery walls, forming plaques (atherosclerosis) and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low LDL level is generally the goal and is very desirable. Extremely low levels may be associated with certain medical conditions but are not usually a problem.
**Improvements:** Generally, no action is required.

## High Results
**Causes:** A diet high in saturated and trans fats, lack of exercise, genetics, and being overweight are the main causes.
**Improvements:** Reduce consumption of saturated fats (fatty meats, whole dairy, fried food) and eliminate trans fats. Increase intake of soluble fiber (oats, legumes, apples), healthy fats (avocado, nuts), and plant sterols. Regular exercise is also very effective.
