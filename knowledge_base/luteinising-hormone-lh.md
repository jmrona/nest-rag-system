# Luteinising Hormone (LH)

## What is it?
Luteinising Hormone (LH) is produced by the pituitary gland. In women, a surge of LH triggers ovulation. In men, it stimulates the testes to produce testosterone.

## Low Results
**Causes:** May indicate a problem in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism). Excessive stress, low body weight, or extreme exercise can also suppress LH levels.
**Improvements:** Requires medical evaluation to determine the cause. Stress management and ensuring adequate nutrition and body weight are important.

## High Results
**Causes:** In women, high levels outside the mid-cycle peak may indicate ovarian failure (menopause) or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), where the LH:FSH ratio is often elevated. In men, it indicates a problem in the testes (primary hypogonadism), which do not respond to the LH signal.
**Improvements:** Treatment focuses on the underlying cause and the patient's goals (e.g., fertility or symptom management).
