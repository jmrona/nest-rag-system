# Uric Acid

## What is it?
Uric acid is a waste product formed when the body breaks down chemical substances called purines, which are found in certain foods and are also produced by the body. It is filtered by the kidneys and eliminated in the urine.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Low levels are uncommon and generally not a problem. They can be associated with certain genetic or liver diseases.
**Improvements:** No action is required.

## High Results (Hyperuricemia)
**Causes:** Can be due to an overproduction of uric acid or, more commonly, because the kidneys do not eliminate it efficiently. Alcohol consumption (especially beer), a diet rich in purines (red meat, seafood, offal), and sugary drinks are risk factors. When levels are very high, crystals can form in the joints, causing gout.
**Improvements:** Reduce consumption of alcohol and purine-rich foods. Avoid sugary drinks with fructose. Maintain good hydration. Weight management and consumption of cherries and vitamin C can help.
