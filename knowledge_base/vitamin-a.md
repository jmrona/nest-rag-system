# Vitamin A

## What is it?
Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin crucial for vision (especially night vision), immune function, reproduction, and the health of the skin and mucous membranes.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Deficiency is rare in developed countries but can occur due to a very restrictive diet or fat malabsorption disorders (as in cystic fibrosis or Crohn's disease).
**Improvements:** Increase intake of foods rich in Vitamin A (liver, dairy, eggs) or its precursor, beta-carotene (carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, red peppers).

## High Results
**Causes:** Vitamin A toxicity (hypervitaminosis A) is almost always due to excessive supplementation with retinol (the animal form of Vitamin A) over a prolonged period. It is very difficult to reach toxic levels from diet alone.
**Improvements:** Discontinue Vitamin A supplementation.
