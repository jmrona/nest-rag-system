# Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)

## What is it?
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found mainly in liver cells. When the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the bloodstream, making it a sensitive marker of liver health.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low ALT level is generally not considered a medical problem and does not usually require intervention. In some cases, it may be associated with a vitamin B6 deficiency.
**Improvements:** No specific action is required, but ensuring an adequate intake of vitamin B6 through a balanced diet is always beneficial.

## High Results
**Causes:** The most common causes include alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (often related to being overweight), viral hepatitis, or liver damage from medications or toxins.
**Improvements:** Reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption. Maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise. Review any medication with a doctor.
