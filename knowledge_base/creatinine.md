# Creatinine

## What is it?
Creatinine is a waste product generated from the normal metabolism of muscles. It is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Its level in the blood is a key indicator of kidney function.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Can be due to low muscle mass, which is more common in the elderly or those with malnutrition. It can also be observed during pregnancy.
**Improvements:** If due to low muscle mass, strength training and an adequate protein diet can help.

## High Results
**Causes:** A high level suggests that the kidneys are not filtering the blood efficiently. It can be a sign of acute or chronic kidney disease. Dehydration or a very high protein intake can also temporarily raise it.
**Improvements:** Medical evaluation is crucial. Maintaining good hydration, controlling blood pressure and blood glucose, and following a balanced, moderate-protein diet are important general measures for kidney health.
