# Urea

## What is it?
Urea is the main waste product of protein metabolism. It is formed in the liver, transported by the blood to the kidneys, and eliminated through the urine. It is an indicator of kidney function and hydration status.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Can be due to a very low-protein diet, malnutrition, or severe liver disease (as the liver cannot produce it). Overhydration can also dilute it.
**Improvements:** If due to diet, ensure adequate protein intake.

## High Results
**Causes:** The most common cause is dehydration or decreased kidney function. An extremely high-protein diet, gastrointestinal bleeding, or increased protein catabolism (breakdown of body proteins) can also raise it.
**Improvements:** Maintaining good hydration is key. If kidney function is compromised, medical management is required. Adjust protein intake according to professional recommendations.
