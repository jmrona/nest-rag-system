# Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)

## What is it?
Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) is a protein produced by the liver that binds to sex hormones (mainly testosterone and oestradiol) in the blood. By binding to them, it inactivates them, thus regulating the amount of "free" or active hormones available to the tissues.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Low SHBG levels mean there is more free testosterone available. This is often associated with insulin resistance, being overweight (especially central obesity), hypothyroidism, and a diet high in refined carbohydrates.
**Improvements:** Weight management, regular exercise, and a low-glycemic index diet can help increase SHBG levels.

## High Results
**Causes:** High SHBG levels reduce the amount of free testosterone, which can cause symptoms of low testosterone in men. It is associated with hyperthyroidism, a very low-calorie diet, aging, and high consumption of alcohol or caffeine.
**Improvements:** Depends on the cause. Ensure adequate caloric and protein intake. Reduce alcohol consumption. Medical evaluation is required if a thyroid problem is suspected.
