# HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)

## What is it?
HDL is known as the "good" cholesterol. It acts as a scavenger, collecting excess cholesterol from the arteries and transporting it back to the liver, where it is processed and removed from the body. High levels of HDL are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A sedentary lifestyle, smoking, a diet high in trans fats and refined carbohydrates, and being overweight (especially abdominal fat) contribute to low HDL levels.
**Improvements:** Regular aerobic exercise (running, swimming, brisk walking) is one of the most effective ways to increase HDL. Incorporating healthy fats into the diet (olive oil, avocados, nuts, fatty fish), quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight.

## High Results
**Causes:** High HDL levels are generally desirable and protective. In extremely high cases (hyperalphalipoproteinemia), there may be genetic factors, but it is not usually considered a problem.
**Improvements:** Keep up the good habits! No action is required.
