# Triiodothyronine (T3 free)

## What is it?
Free T3 (free triiodothyronine) is the most active form of thyroid hormone. Most of it is produced by the conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues (like the liver and kidneys). It measures the hormone that is actually available to act on cells.

## Low Results
**Causes:** May indicate hypothyroidism. Sometimes, TSH and free T4 are normal, but free T3 is low, suggesting a problem with the T4 to T3 conversion. This can be affected by stress, nutritional deficiencies (selenium, zinc), or chronic diseases.
**Improvements:** Optimize factors affecting conversion: manage stress, ensure adequate nutrition. Sometimes, the addition of synthetic T3 (liothyronine) to levothyroxine treatment may be considered.

## High Results
**Causes:** It is a sign of hyperthyroidism, often with low TSH and high free T4. In a condition called "T3 toxicosis," only T3 is elevated.
**Improvements:** Requires medical treatment to control thyroid hyperactivity.
