# Sodium

## What is it?
Sodium is a vital electrolyte for maintaining the body's fluid balance, blood pressure, and nerve and muscle function.

## Low Results (Hyponatremia)
**Causes:** Often not due to a lack of sodium in the diet, but to an excess of water in the body that dilutes it. It can be caused by drinking excessive amounts of water, heart failure, kidney or liver disease, or the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).
**Improvements:** Treatment focuses on the underlying cause and may involve fluid restriction.

## High Results (Hypernatremia)
**Causes:** The most common cause is dehydration: not drinking enough fluids or losing too much through sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea. Rarely, it can be due to a massive salt intake or a condition called diabetes insipidus.
**Improvements:** Rehydration by drinking water is key. It is important to do this gradually to allow the body to adjust.
