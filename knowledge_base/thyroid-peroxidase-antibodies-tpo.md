# Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPO)

## What is it?
Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) attack the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, which is crucial for the production of thyroid hormones. Like TGAb, their presence is a strong indicator of an autoimmune thyroid disease.

## Low Results (Negative)
**Causes:** A negative result is normal and largely rules out an autoimmune cause for a thyroid problem.
**Improvements:** No action is required.

## High Results (Positive)
**Causes:** It is the most sensitive marker for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. Over 90% of people with Hashimoto's have elevated TPOAb. They can also be present in Graves' Disease.
**Improvements:** The approach is the same as for elevated TGAb: treat the underlying thyroid dysfunction and adopt a lifestyle that modulates the immune response and reduces inflammation.
