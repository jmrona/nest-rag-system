# Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)

## What is it?
Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. In women, it stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles before the release of an egg. In men, it is crucial for sperm production.

## Low Results
**Causes:** In both sexes, it may indicate a problem with the function of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. In women, it can cause irregular or absent menstrual cycles.
**Improvements:** Requires an endocrinological evaluation to determine the cause. Treatment will focus on the underlying condition.

## High Results
**Causes:** In women, high levels are often a sign of diminished ovarian reserve or ovarian failure, and it is a key marker of perimenopause and menopause. In men, it may indicate primary testicular failure.
**Improvements:** Treatment depends on the cause and goals (e.g., fertility). The FSH level itself is not "improved," but the underlying condition is managed.
