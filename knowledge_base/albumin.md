# Albumin

## What is it?
Albumin is the most abundant protein in blood plasma. It is produced by the liver and has crucial functions, such as maintaining osmotic pressure (preventing fluid from leaking out of blood vessels) and transporting hormones, vitamins, and drugs throughout the body.

## Low Results
**Causes**: May indicate liver problems (as the liver produces it), kidney disease (it is lost in the urine), malnutrition, or chronic inflammatory states.
**Improvements**: Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Generally, ensuring adequate protein intake through diet (meat, fish, eggs, legumes) is important.

## High Results
**Causes**: It is usually a sign of dehydration, as the concentration of albumin increases when the volume of fluid in the blood decreases.
**Improvements**: Ensure adequate hydration by drinking enough fluids, mainly water, throughout the day.
