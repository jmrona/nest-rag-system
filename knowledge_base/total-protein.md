# Total Protein

## What is it?
Total protein measures the total amount of the two main classes of proteins in the blood: albumin and globulin. It is a general indicator of nutritional status and the health of the liver and kidneys.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Can be the result of insufficient dietary protein intake, malabsorption, severe liver disease (as the liver produces most proteins), or kidney disease (where proteins are lost in the urine).
**Improvements:** Ensure adequate intake of high-quality protein. Treat the underlying medical condition.

## High Results
**Causes:** Often associated with chronic inflammation or infection, as the body increases the production of globulins (antibodies). Certain blood cancers, like multiple myeloma, can also cause very high levels. Dehydration can also concentrate proteins.
**Improvements:** It is crucial to identify the cause. If due to dehydration, rehydrate. If due to inflammation or a medical condition, the root cause must be treated.
