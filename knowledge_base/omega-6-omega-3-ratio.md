# Omega 6: Omega 3 Ratio

## What is it?
This ratio compares the amount of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in the body. While both are essential, modern Western diets tend to be extremely high in omega-6 (pro-inflammatory) and low in omega-3 (anti-inflammatory). An imbalanced ratio is associated with increased chronic inflammation.

## Low Results (Ideal Ratio)
**Causes:** A low ratio (ideally close to 4:1 or lower) is the goal. It indicates a good balance between these fats, which promotes an anti-inflammatory state.
**Improvements:** Excellent! Maintain a diet rich in omega-3s.

## High Results (Imbalanced Ratio)
**Causes:** It is due to a high consumption of omega-6-rich foods (vegetable oils like sunflower or corn oil, processed foods, fried foods) and a low consumption of omega-3-rich foods.
**Improvements:** The goal is twofold: reduce omega-6 intake and increase omega-3 intake. Increase consumption of fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel), chia seeds, flax seeds, and walnuts. Consider a high-quality fish oil supplement (EPA/DHA).
