# Progesterone

## What is it?
Progesterone is a steroid hormone crucial in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. It is mainly produced by the corpus luteum in the ovary after ovulation. It prepares the uterus for a possible pregnancy and helps maintain it.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low level in the second half of the menstrual cycle (luteal phase) may indicate that ovulation has not occurred (anovulatory cycle) or poor corpus luteum function. It can make it difficult to conceive and maintain a pregnancy.
**Improvements:** Stress management, adequate nutrition, and a healthy body weight can promote ovulation. Gynecological evaluation is required to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

## High Results
**Causes:** High levels are normally seen during pregnancy. Outside of pregnancy, they can be associated with certain ovarian cysts or, rarely, tumors.
**Improvements:** Depends on the cause. If there is no pregnancy, medical investigation is needed.
