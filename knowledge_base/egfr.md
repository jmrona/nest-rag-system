# eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate)

## What is it?
The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is not a direct measurement but a calculation based on the blood creatinine level, age, sex, and ethnicity. It estimates how well the kidneys are working to filter waste from the blood.

## Low Results
**Causes:** An eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73mÂ² for three months or more indicates chronic kidney disease. The main causes are diabetes and high blood pressure.
**Improvements:** The goal is to slow the progression of kidney damage. This involves strict control of blood pressure and blood sugar, following a kidney-healthy diet (often low in sodium and protein), not smoking, and avoiding medications that can harm the kidneys.

## High Results
**Causes:** A high eGFR (usually > 120) is not usually a cause for concern and is often seen in young, healthy individuals. It does not indicate a problem.
**Improvements:** No action is required.
