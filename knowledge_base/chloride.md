# Chloride

## What is it?
Chloride is a crucial electrolyte that works with sodium and potassium to maintain the body's fluid balance and pH (acid-base balance).

## Low Results
**Causes:** Can be caused by excessive loss of body fluids due to prolonged vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating. It can also be associated with congestive heart failure or certain kidney diseases.
**Improvements:** Treatment focuses on replenishing fluids and electrolytes and treating the underlying cause. Oral rehydration solutions can be useful in cases of dehydration.

## High Results
**Causes:** Often due to dehydration, kidney disease, or a condition called metabolic acidosis (when the blood is too acidic). A very high salt intake can also contribute.
**Improvements:** Increase fluid intake (water) to correct dehydration. Reduce consumption of processed foods and table salt.
