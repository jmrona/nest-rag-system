# Red Blood Cell (RBC)

## What is it?
The red blood cell (RBC) count measures the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. These cells contain haemoglobin and are responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low count is a sign of anemia. The causes are the same as for low haemoglobin: deficiencies of iron, B12, or folate, chronic diseases, blood loss, or bone marrow problems.
**Improvements:** Treatment focuses on correcting the cause of the anemia, whether through diet, supplements, or management of the underlying medical condition.

## High Results (Polycythemia)
**Causes:** Can be a response to the need for more oxygen, as in smokers or people living at high altitude. It can also be a sign of a bone marrow disease (polycythemia vera) or dehydration.
**Improvements:** Quit smoking and ensure good hydration. If a medical cause is suspected, evaluation by a hematologist is needed.
