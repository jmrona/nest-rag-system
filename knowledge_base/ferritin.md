# Ferritin

## What is it?
Ferritin is a blood protein that contains iron. It is the main indicator of the body's iron stores. A ferritin test helps to understand how much iron your body has stored.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low ferritin level is the earliest sign of iron deficiency. It can be caused by insufficient dietary intake (common in vegans), poor absorption (celiac disease, Crohn's), or blood loss (heavy menstruation, gastrointestinal bleeding).
**Improvements:** Increase intake of iron-rich foods such as lean red meat, poultry, fish, legumes, and green leafy vegetables. Consuming these foods with vitamin C (citrus fruits, peppers) improves absorption. An iron supplement may be necessary under medical supervision.

## High Results
**Causes:** Elevated levels can indicate iron overload (hemochromatosis), chronic inflammation, liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption, or infection. Ferritin is an "acute-phase reactant," meaning it increases with inflammation.
**Improvements:** Requires medical investigation to determine the cause. If due to iron overload, treatment may include phlebotomies (blood draws). If due to inflammation, the underlying cause must be treated.
