# Folate (serum)

## What is it?
Folate (Vitamin B9) is an essential vitamin that plays a vital role in DNA synthesis and repair, as well as in the production of red blood cells. Serum folate measures the amount of this vitamin in the blood.

## Low Results
**Causes:** The most common cause is insufficient dietary intake. Alcoholism, certain medications, and malabsorption disorders can also lead to deficiency.
**Improvements:** Increase consumption of folate-rich foods, such as dark green leafy vegetables (spinach, broccoli), legumes, sunflower seeds, and fortified foods (bread, cereals). A supplement may be necessary.

## High Results
**Causes:** Generally due to supplementation with folic acid (the synthetic form of folate) or consumption of highly fortified foods. It is not usually considered toxic, but very high levels can mask a Vitamin B12 deficiency.
**Improvements:** If due to supplements, the dose can be adjusted. It is important to ensure that Vitamin B12 levels are also adequate.
