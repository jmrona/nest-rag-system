# Triglycerides

## What is it?
Triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides, which are stored in fat cells. They are released for energy between meals.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Low levels are not usually a cause for concern and may be associated with a low-fat diet or hyperthyroidism.
**Improvements:** Generally, no action is required.

## High Results
**Causes:** Excessive calorie intake, especially from sugar, refined carbohydrates, and alcohol, is the main cause. Being overweight, sedentary, and having insulin resistance (prediabetes/diabetes) are also key factors.
**Improvements:** The most effective measure is to drastically reduce the consumption of sugar and processed carbohydrates. Limit alcohol. Increase physical activity. Incorporate healthy fats, especially omega-3s (fatty fish).
