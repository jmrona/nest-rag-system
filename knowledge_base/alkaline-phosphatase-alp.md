# Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)

## What is it?
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme present in various body tissues but is found in higher concentrations in the liver, bile ducts, and bones.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Low levels are uncommon but can be associated with malnutrition, zinc deficiency, or a rare genetic condition called hypophosphatasia.
**Improvements:** Generally requires no intervention unless symptomatic. Ensure a nutrient-rich diet, including zinc (found in meat, seafood, legumes, and seeds).

## High Results
**Causes:** Can indicate liver disease, bile duct obstruction, or a bone condition involving high cell turnover (such as in fracture healing, Paget's disease, or Vitamin D deficiency). It is normal for it to be elevated in growing children and adolescents.
**Improvements:** Treatment depends on the cause. If liver-related, the same recommendations as for elevated ALT apply. If bone-related, it may be necessary to assess Vitamin D and calcium levels.
