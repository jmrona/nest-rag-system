# Vitamin D (25 OH)

## What is it?
Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts like a hormone. It is essential for calcium absorption and bone health, but also plays a vital role in immune function, mood regulation, and muscle health.

## Low Results
**Causes:** The main cause is lack of exposure to sunlight, as the skin produces Vitamin D in response to UVB rays. It is extremely common in latitudes like the UK, especially in autumn and winter. A diet poor in Vitamin D also contributes.
**Improvements:** Increase safe sun exposure (15-20 minutes a day on arms and legs during summer months). Consume Vitamin D-rich foods like fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), eggs, and fortified foods. Most people benefit from a daily supplement, especially during the darker months.

## High Results
**Causes:** Toxicity is rare and is almost always the result of excessive and prolonged supplementation with very high doses. It is impossible to reach toxic levels from sun exposure or diet.
**Improvements:** Discontinue or reduce the dose of the Vitamin D supplement under medical supervision.
