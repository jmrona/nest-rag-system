# Cortisol (9am)

## What is it?
Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands, known as the "stress hormone". It follows a diurnal rhythm, peaking in the morning (around 8-9 am) to help us wake up and start the day, and decreasing at night. Measuring it at 9 am assesses this morning peak.

## Low Results
**Causes:** May indicate adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), where the glands do not produce enough hormones. It can also be the result of prolonged use of steroids that suppresses natural production.
**Improvements:** Requires a thorough medical evaluation. Treatment may involve hormone replacement therapy. Chronic stress management techniques are important for overall adrenal health.

## High Results
**Causes:** Chronic stress is a very common functional cause. It can also indicate a medical condition like Cushing's syndrome, caused by a tumor in the pituitary or adrenal gland.
**Improvements:** Stress management is key: relaxation techniques, meditation, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. If a medical cause is suspected, endocrinological investigation is necessary.
