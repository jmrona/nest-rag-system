# Total Cholesterol

## What is it?
Total cholesterol is a measure that adds up all types of cholesterol in the blood, including LDL ("bad" cholesterol), HDL ("good" cholesterol), and other lipoproteins.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Very low cholesterol levels are uncommon and may be associated with malnutrition, liver disease, or hyperthyroidism. They are not usually a goal to pursue.
**Improvements:** Generally, no intervention is required, unless there is an underlying medical condition.

## High Results
**Causes:** It is due to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, mainly a diet high in saturated and trans fats, and lack of exercise.
**Improvements:** The main focus is to reduce LDL cholesterol. This is achieved through a heart-healthy diet (rich in fiber, low in saturated fats), regular exercise, and weight management.
