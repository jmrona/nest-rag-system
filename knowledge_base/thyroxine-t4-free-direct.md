# Thyroxine (T4 free direct)

## What is it?
Free T4 (free thyroxine) measures the active form of the thyroxine hormone that is not bound to proteins and is available for use by the body's cells. It is a direct reflection of the thyroid gland's production.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low free T4, usually accompanied by a high TSH, confirms the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism (a problem in the thyroid gland itself).
**Improvements:** Treatment is replacement therapy with levothyroxine to normalize hormone levels.

## High Results
**Causes:** A high free T4, usually with a low TSH, confirms the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
**Improvements:** Requires medical treatment to reduce thyroid hormone production.
