# White Blood Cell Count (WBC)

## What is it?
The white blood cell (WBC) count measures the total number of white blood cells in the blood. These cells are the army of the immune system, responsible for fighting infections and responding to inflammation.

## Low Results (Leukopenia)
**Causes:** Can be caused by viral infections (which sometimes temporarily deplete white blood cells), autoimmune disorders, bone marrow problems, or as a side effect of certain medications (like chemotherapy).
**Improvements:** Requires medical investigation to determine the cause. Treatment focuses on the underlying condition.

## High Results (Leucocytosis)
**Causes:** The most common cause is a bacterial infection, as the body increases the production of white blood cells to fight it. Inflammation, intense physical stress, smoking, or, in rarer cases, leukemia can also raise the count.
**Improvements:** Treat the underlying infection or cause of inflammation. If there is no clear infectious cause, a more thorough medical evaluation is needed.
