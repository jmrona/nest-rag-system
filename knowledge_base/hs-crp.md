# hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)

## What is it?
High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) is a marker of inflammation in the body. Unlike standard CRP, the high-sensitivity test can detect very low levels of chronic inflammation, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low level is ideal and indicates an absence of significant inflammation in the body, which is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk.
**Improvements:** Congratulations! Maintain an anti-inflammatory lifestyle.

## High Results
**Causes:** Elevated levels suggest the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation. The causes can be varied: being overweight or obese, a pro-inflammatory diet (rich in sugars and processed fats), a sedentary lifestyle, chronic stress, smoking, or an undiagnosed infection or disease.
**Improvements:** Adopt an anti-inflammatory diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, fatty fish, olive oil), exercise regularly, manage stress, ensure quality sleep, and quit smoking.
