# Free Androgen Index

## What is it?
The Free Androgen Index (FAI) is not a direct measurement but a calculation that uses total testosterone and Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) levels to estimate the amount of "free" or biologically active testosterone. (FAI = Total Testosterone / SHBG * 100).

## Low Results
**Causes:** In men, it indicates low active testosterone, which can cause symptoms like fatigue, low libido, and decreased muscle mass. It may be due to high SHBG or low total testosterone levels.
**Improvements:** Increasing active testosterone may involve strength training, weight management, adequate sleep, and stress management. Reducing factors that increase SHBG (like excessive alcohol consumption) can also help.

## High Results
**Causes:** In women, a high FAI is a key marker of hyperandrogenism (excess androgens), often associated with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It can cause symptoms like acne, hirsutism (excess hair), and irregular cycles.
**Improvements:** Management focuses on the underlying cause. For PCOS, strategies include weight management, a low-glycemic index diet, and regular exercise.
