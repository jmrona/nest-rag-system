# Prolactin

## What is it?
Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. Its main function is to stimulate breast milk production after childbirth.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Low prolactin levels are not usually a clinical problem and generally do not require treatment.
**Improvements:** No action is required.

## High Results (Hyperprolactinemia)
**Causes:** Apart from pregnancy and breastfeeding, causes can include a benign tumor in the pituitary gland (prolactinoma), hypothyroidism, PCOS, or the side effect of certain medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics). Intense physical or emotional stress can also temporarily raise it.
**Improvements:** Requires medical evaluation to find the cause. Treatment may include medications to lower prolactin levels or treat the underlying condition (e.g., thyroid).
