# HbA1c (Glycated Haemoglobin)

## What is it?
Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measures the amount of glucose (sugar) that has attached to haemoglobin in red blood cells. As red blood cells live for about 3 months, this test provides an excellent view of the average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low level is not usually a problem, unless it is extremely low, which could indicate episodes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or be associated with certain conditions like hemolytic anemia.
**Improvements:** Generally, no intervention is required.

## High Results
**Causes:** An elevated level indicates poor blood sugar control and is a key marker for the diagnosis of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. It is due to insulin resistance, a diet high in sugars and refined carbohydrates, and lack of physical activity.
**Improvements:** Diet and lifestyle are fundamental. Reduce consumption of sugars and processed carbohydrates, increase fiber intake, perform regular aerobic and strength exercise, and maintain a healthy weight.
