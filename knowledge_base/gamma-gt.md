# Gamma GT (GGT)

## What is it?
Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) is an enzyme found throughout the body, but mainly in the liver. It is very sensitive to changes in liver function and is often the first liver marker to rise when there is a problem.

## Low Results
**Causes:** Low GGT levels have no clinical significance and are not a cause for concern.
**Improvements:** No action is required.

## High Results
**Causes:** Alcohol consumption, even in moderate amounts, is one of the most common causes of GGT elevation. Other causes include fatty liver disease, bile duct obstruction, and the side effects of certain medications.
**Improvements:** Abstinence or significant reduction of alcohol consumption is the most effective step. Maintaining a healthy weight, following a balanced diet, and reviewing medications with a doctor are also important.
