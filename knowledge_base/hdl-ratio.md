# HDL Ratio (Total Cholesterol:HDL Ratio)

## What is it?
This ratio is calculated by dividing total cholesterol by the HDL cholesterol level. It offers a more comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular risk than looking at total cholesterol or LDL alone. A lower ratio is considered better.

## Low Results
**Causes:** A low ratio is the desired goal. It indicates that you have a healthy proportion of "good" cholesterol (HDL) compared to your total cholesterol.
**Improvements:** Excellent! Maintain the healthy lifestyle habits that have led to this result.

## High Results
**Causes:** A high ratio indicates an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It is due to an elevated total cholesterol level, a low HDL level, or a combination of both. The underlying causes are the same as for high cholesterol and low HDL (diet, sedentary lifestyle, genetics).
**Improvements:** The goal is twofold: lower total cholesterol (mainly LDL) and increase HDL. This is achieved with a diet rich in fiber and healthy fats, regular exercise, and weight management.
