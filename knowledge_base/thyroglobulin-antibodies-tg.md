# Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TG)

## What is it?
Thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb) are antibodies that the immune system mistakenly produces against thyroglobulin, a protein produced by the thyroid gland that is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Their presence is a marker of autoimmune thyroid disease.

## Low Results (Negative)
**Causes:** A negative result is normal and indicates that there is no significant autoimmune response against thyroglobulin.
**Improvements:** No action is required.

## High Results (Positive)
**Causes:** The presence of these antibodies is a characteristic sign of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism. They can also be present in Graves' Disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism).
**Improvements:** The antibodies themselves are not "treated." Management focuses on optimizing thyroid function (often with medication like levothyroxine) and reducing overall inflammation through an anti-inflammatory diet, stress management, and ensuring adequate levels of selenium and vitamin D.
