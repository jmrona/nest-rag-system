# Corrected Calcium

## What is it?
Corrected calcium is a calculation that adjusts the total calcium level in the blood according to the albumin concentration. As much of the calcium is bound to albumin, this calculation provides a more accurate estimate of "active" or ionized calcium, especially if albumin levels are abnormal.

## Low Results (Hypocalcemia)
**Causes:** Common causes include Vitamin D deficiency (necessary to absorb calcium), low parathyroid gland activity (hypoparathyroidism), or chronic kidney disease.
**Improvements:** Increase intake of calcium-rich foods (dairy, green leafy vegetables, fortified foods) and ensure adequate Vitamin D levels through sun exposure or supplements.

## High Results (Hypercalcemia)
**Causes:** The most frequent cause is an overactive parathyroid gland (hyperparathyroidism). Other causes can be certain types of cancer, excessive supplementation of calcium or Vitamin D, or prolonged immobility.
**Improvements:** Requires medical investigation to determine the cause. It is important to maintain good hydration and avoid calcium supplements until a diagnosis is clarified.
